# Orbit Tool
This is a simple streamlit web app that uses the various orbit propagators in [MichaszJ/scripts](https://github.com/MichaszJ/scripts) to simulate orbits based on inputted initial conditions. Each propagator comes with default values that provide an interesting orbit, however they can be changed to suit the user's requirements. The initial conditions are inputted in the left sidebar and the propagator is run when the 'Calculate' box is checked. The app will then plot the results, and the user is able to choose how many lines and which variables to plot.

The app can be found on [streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/michaszj/orbit-tool/main/orbit_tool.py)
